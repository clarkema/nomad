Nomad
=====

Nomad is my personal dotfile repository.  Much has been 'borrowed' from
the many other excellent dotfile repositories out there, but then broken
down and reassembled to suit my personal tastes, needs, and working
style.

To paraphrase the YADR documentation: "Vim is the best editor.  Zsh is
the best shell.  Solarized is the best colour scheme..." _BUT_ I work as
a consultant and contractor.  I might find myself working on my OS X
laptop, a modern FreeBSD installation, a Debian machine, and a crufty
old server with minimal facilities within the space of a day.  This
repository is my attempt to make the best of whatever is available, in
order to provide myself with the most productive environment possible.
