# Dynamic desktop behaviour:  this invokes a script of mine that
# implements dynamic desktops (see dotfiles).  If the given desktop
# number is missing, it is created on the spot.  Empty desktops are then
# removed automatically.
#
#
# super + <number> = focus the given desktop
# super + shift + <number> = send focused window to given desktop
# super + ctrl + shift + <number> = as above, but send to next monitor
# super + ctrl + <number> = switches the active (visible) desktop of the
# unfocused monitor, without focusing it (focus stays on the current
# desktop/monitor).  It also inserts a receptacle, meaning that the next
# created window will go there without calling focus to itself (see my
# bspwm_external_rules).
#
#
# Commands for receptacles are defined in the "advanced operations"
# section.
#
# NOTE the leading `;` runs this command asynchronously.
